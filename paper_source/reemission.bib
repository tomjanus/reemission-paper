So far, efforts to quantify, model, and manage these emissions have been limited by data availability and inconsistencies in methodological approach. Here, we synthesize reservoir CH4, CO2, and N2O emission data with three main objectives: (1) to generate a global estimate of GHG emissions from reservoirs, (2) to identify the best predictors of these emissions, and (3) to consider the effect of methodology on emission estimates. We estimate that GHG emissions from reservoir water surfaces account for 0.8 (0.5–1.2) Pg CO2 equivalents per year, with the majority of this forcing due to CH4. We then discuss the potential for several alternative pathways such as dam degassing and downstream emissions to contribute significantly to overall emissions. Although prior studies have linked reservoir GHG emissions to reservoir age and latitude, we find that factors related to reservoir productivity are better predictors of emission.}",

Based on 158 existing and 351 proposed dams, we present a multi-objective optimization framework showing that low-carbon expansion of Amazon hydropower relies on strategic planning, which is generally linked to placing dams in higher elevations and smaller streams. Ultimately, basin-scale dam planning that considers GHG emissions along with social and ecological externalities will be decisive for sustainable energy development where new hydropower is contemplated.},

  abstract = {Abstract Collectively, reservoirs constitute a significant global source of C-based greenhouse gases (GHGs). Yet, global estimates of reservoir carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions remain uncertain, varying more than four-fold in recent analyses. Here we present results from a global application of the Greenhouse Gas from Reservoirs (G-res) model wherein we estimate per-area and per-reservoir CO2 and CH4 fluxes, by specific flux pathway and in a spatially and temporally explicit manner, as a function of reservoir characteristics. We show: (a) CH4 fluxes via degassing and ebullition are much larger than previously recognized and diffusive CH4 fluxes are lower than previously estimated, while CO2 emissions are similar to those reported in past work; (b) per-area reservoir GHG fluxes are >29\% higher than suggested by previous studies, due in large part to our novel inclusion of the degassing flux in our global estimate; (c) CO2 flux is the dominant emissions pathway in boreal regions and CH4 degassing and ebullition are dominant in tropical and subtropical regions, with the highest overall reservoir GHG fluxes in the tropics and subtropics; and (d) reservoir GHG fluxes are quite sensitive to input parameters that are both poorly constrained and likely to be strongly influenced by climate change in coming decades (parameters such as temperature and littoral area, where the latter may be expanded by deepening thermoclines expected to accompany warming surface waters). Together these results highlight a critical need to both better understand climate-related drivers of GHG emission and to better quantify GHG emissions via CH4 ebullition and degassing.},

The decline of NS values is especially pronounced in the global south, while the global north mainly exhibits an NS increase.

These dams are predicted to increase the present global hydroelectricity capacity by 73 {\%} to about 1,700 GW. Even such a dramatic expansion in hydropower capacity will be insufficient to compensate for the increasing electricity demand. Furthermore, it will only partially close the electricity gap, may not substantially reduce greenhouse gas emission (carbon dioxide and methane), and may not erase interdependencies and social conflicts. At the same time, it is certain to reduce the number of our planet's remaining free-flowing large rivers by about 21 {\%}. Clearly, there is an urgent need to evaluate and to mitigate the social, economic, and ecological ramifications of the current boom in global dam construction.},

abstract = {Reservoirs are significant sources of atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs), counteracting terrestrial carbon sequestration. However, the estimates of GHG emission from reservoirs remain uncertain, largely due to substantial variations in GHG fluxes across space and time. This study developed a C-GHG (i.e., CO2 and CH4) module embedded in the environmental fluid dynamic codes (EFDC) to estimate the spatial and temporal variations of CO2 and CH4 from reservoirs. The developed model accounted for primary physical and biogeochemical processes that control the production, transport, and emission of CO2 and CH4, including heterotrophic respiration, CO2 fractionation, sediment methanogenesis, CH4 ebullition and oxidation. The model was evaluated by simulating CO2 and CH4 concentrations as well as CO2 flux in a typical reservoir in Southwest China. The results illustrated that the developed model well reproduced the dynamics of CO2 and CH4 throughout the whole year in multiple sites in the reservoir. Moreover, the model depicted the spatiotemporal variations of CO2 and CH4 fluxes, and found that tributary areas with shallow water depth were hotspots of C-GHG emissions. The reservoir was a CO2 source only in autumn and winter, but a CH4 source throughout the year. Over a 100-year time horizon, CH4 contributed 81.5% of the reservoir’s global warming potential (GWP) of 378.28 g CO2-eq m−2 yr−1, with CH4 ebullition generating 66.5% of the total CH4 emission. Overall, the developed model provides a feasible tool to quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of C-GHG in reservoirs and highlights the importance of CH4 ebullition from tributary regions, which suggests that current estimates may underestimate GHG emissions from reservoirs.}

In this paper, we review the main processes involved in the generation of GHG in reservoir systems and propose a simple approach to quantify the reservoir GHG footprint in terms of the net changes in GHG fluxes to the atmosphere induced by damming, that is, `what the atmosphere sees.' The approach takes into account the pre-impoundment GHG balance of the landscape, the temporal evolution of reservoir GHG emission profile as well as the natural emissions that are displaced to or away from the reservoir site resulting from hydrological and other changes. It also clarifies the portion of the reservoir carbon burial that can potentially be considered an offset to GHG emissions.},

Bearing in mind the lack of LCA studies and the development of several hydroelectric projects in Ecuador, the purpose of this paper is to present a complete environmental performance of two hydropower schemes (dam and run-of-river) located in this country, through the life cycle assessment combined with reservoir GHG emissions approach. The run-of-river scheme had better environmental performance than the dam scheme. Very high emissions were found, being 547 Kg CO2-eq/MWh for dam scheme, which most of those emissions were originated in the reservoir, while the run-of-river scheme only score 2.6 Kg CO2-eq/MWh. However, comparing with fossil fuel power plants, hydropower dam case still has lower emissions in its entire life cycle. The paper remark that the majority of LCA studies which focus on dam hydropower scheme only consider the emissions of the construction, putting aside the loss of the ecosystem and the emissions caused by the impoundment. Moreover, the analysis also included the impact associated to water uses since reservoirs are usually devoted to several purposes (flood lamination, irrigation, ecological flow, power generation).},

We provide the first screening of GHG emissions of 141 existing and planned reservoirs in the basin, with a focus on atmospheric gross emissions through the reservoir water surface. The emissions were estimated using statistical models that are based on global emission measurements. The hydropower reservoirs (119) were found to have an emission range of 0.2–1994 kg CO2e MWh−1 over a 100 year lifetime with a median of 26 kg CO2e MWh−1. Hydropower reservoirs facilitating irrigation (22) had generally higher emissions reaching over 22 000 kg CO2e MWh−1. The emission fluxes for all reservoirs (141) had a range of 26–1813 000 t CO2e yr−1 over a 100 year lifetime with a median of 28 000 t CO2e yr−1. Altogether, 82% of hydropower reservoirs (119) and 45% of reservoirs also facilitating irrigation (22) have emissions comparable to other renewable energy sources (&lt;190 kg CO2e MWh−1), while the rest have higher emissions equalling even the emission from fossil fuel power plants (&gt;380 kg CO2e MWh−1). These results are tentative and they suggest that hydropower in the Mekong Region cannot be considered categorically as low-emission energy. Instead, the GHG emissions of hydropower should be carefully considered case-by-case together with the other impacts on the natural and social environment.},

Yet the temporal evolution of reservoir carbon emissions and their contribution to anthropogenic radiative forcing remains unresolved. Here we quantify the long-term historical and future evolution (1900--2060) of cumulative global reservoir area, carbon dioxide and methane emissions and the resulting radiative forcing. We show that global reservoir carbon emissions peaked in 1987 (4.4{\thinspace}TmolC{\thinspace}yr−1) and have been declining since, due largely to decreasing carbon dioxide emissions as reservoirs age. However, reservoir-induced radiative forcing continues to rise due to ongoing increases in reservoir methane emissions, which accounted for 5.2{\%} of global anthropogenic methane emissions in 2020. We estimate that, in the future, methane ebullition and degassing flux will make up >75{\%} of the reservoir-induced radiative forcing, making these flux pathways key targets for improved understanding and mitigation.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to evaluate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a reservoir or from several reservoirs in a country or a climatic zone, simpler or more complex models based on measurements and analyses of emissions presented in the literature were developed, which take into account one or more reservoir-specific parameters. The application of the models in the assessment of GHG emissions from a multipurpose reservoir gave values that are more or less close to the average values reported in the literature for the temperate zone reservoirs. This is explained by the fact that some models only consider emissions caused by impoundment and not degassing, spillway emissions, and downstream emissions, or those that use different calculation periods. The only model that calculates GHG emissions over the life cycle that occur pre-impoundment, post-impoundment, from unrelated anthropogenic sources and due to the reservoir construction is the model used by the G-res tool. In addition, this tool is best suited for multipurpose reservoirs because it allocates GHG emissions for each use, thus facilitating the correct reporting of emissions. The G-res tool used to calculate GHG emissions from the Stânca-Costești Multipurpose Reservoir shows that this is a sink of GHG with a net emission of −5 g CO2eq/m2/yr (without taking into account the emissions due to dam construction).},

abstract = {Hydroelectric reservoirs emit substantial amounts of CO2, especially in the tropics. Since many such systems exist and many more will be built within decades, it is important to assess their role in the carbon cycle. A major source of emission that is rarely monitored and never at different timescales is the carbon released downstream of dams. We measured the seasonal and subdaily variability of CO2 emission downstream of one of the world’s largest artificial reservoirs and find that its contribution is relevant for unbiased quantification of reservoir carbon budgets. These findings highlight the importance of subdaily variability in hydropower operation for downstream emission rates and call for appropriate analysis schemes to reassess the greenhouse gas footprint of this energy source. Recent studies show that tropical hydroelectric reservoirs may be responsible for substantial greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere, yet emissions from the surface of released water downstream of the dam are poorly characterized if not neglected entirely from most assessments. We found that carbon dioxide (CO2) emission downstream of Kariba Dam (southern Africa) varied widely over different timescales and that accounting for downstream emissions and their fluctuations is critically important to the reservoir carbon budget. Seasonal variation was driven by reservoir stratification and the accumulation of CO2 in hypolimnetic waters, while subdaily variation was driven by hydropeaking events caused by dam operation in response to daily electricity demand. This “carbopeaking” resulted in hourly variations of CO2 emission up to 200\% during stratification. Failing to account for seasonal or subdaily variations in downstream carbon emissions could lead to errors of up to 90\% when estimating the reservoir’s annual emissions. These results demonstrate the critical need to include both limnological seasonality and dam operation at subdaily time steps in the assessment of carbon budgeting of reservoirs and carbon cycling along the aquatic continuum.}}

abstract = {Degassing methane (CH4) through reservoir water compromises hydroelectricity's presumed low-carbon status, which has emerged as a critical hotspot for global carbon dynamics. However, a comprehensive understanding of the involved pathways remains elusive, hindering the accurate estimation of global reservoirs' carbon budget (emission-to-burial ratio). This study presents a holistic upscaling approach to assess methane degassing in global river reservoirs and its impacts on carbon budgets. Firstly, a machine learning model is utilized to characterize the contributions of climate and human factors to annual water residence time. Secondly, the stepwise multiple linear regression method is used to calculate CH4 degassing emissions for each reservoir. Finally, to systematically tackle all sources of uncertainty, separate uncertainty analyses are implemented for the estimates of degassing emissions, areal emissions, and organic carbon burial. Analyzing 30-year data from 6695 reservoirs worldwide, our assessment considers water residence time, temperature, catchment area, and reservoir size. Findings indicate that water releases contribute significantly to global CO2 emissions from reservoirs, elevating the carbon budget by 20 % from 2.02 to 2.18 TgC/year, underscoring the previously underestimated significance of CH4 degassing in shaping the carbon cycle impact of river reservoirs. We propose a redefined threshold for low carbon credits, suggesting that reservoirs with power densities exceeding 6.1 MW/km2, instead of the conventional 4 MW/km2, should qualify. This study underscores the need for sustainable water management and reshaping the carbon dynamics associated with hydroelectricity. Future research can advocate Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to enhance water management and mitigate carbon emissions by multi-objectively optimizing reservoir operations.}

  abstract = {Abstract Methane is an important greenhouse gas with growing atmospheric concentrations. Freshwater lakes and reservoirs contribute substantially to atmospheric methane concentrations, but the magnitude of this contribution is poorly constrained. Uncertainty stems partially from whether the sites currently sampled represent the global population as well as incomplete knowledge of which environmental variables predict methane flux. Thus, determining the main drivers of methane flux across diverse waterbody types will inform more accurate upscaling approaches. Here we use a new database of total, diffusive, and ebullitive areal methane emissions from 313 lakes and reservoirs (ranging in surface area from 6 m2 to 5,400 km2) to identify the best predictors of methane emission. We found that the best predictors of methane emission differed by waterbody type (lakes vs. reservoirs), and that ecosystem morphometric variables (e.g., surface area and maximum depth) were more important predictors in lakes whereas metrics of autochthonous production (e.g., chlorophyll a) were more important in reservoirs. We also found that productivity strongly predicted methane ebullition, whereas ecosystem morphometry and waterbody type were more important predictors of diffusive methane flux. Finally, we identify several knowledge gaps that limit upscaling efforts. First, we need more methane emission measurements in small reservoirs, large lakes, and both natural and artificial ponds. Additionally, more accurate upscaling efforts require improved global information about waterbody surface area, waterbody type (lake vs. reservoir), ice phenology, and the distribution of productivity-related predictor variables such as total phosphorus, DOC, and chlorophyll a.},

abstract={Periphyton (viz. algal) growth in many freshwater systems is associated with severe eutrophication that can impair productive and recreational use of water by billions of people. However, there has been limited analysis of periphyton growth at a global level. To predict where nutrient over-enrichment and undesirable periphyton growth occurs, we combined several databases to model and map global dissolved and total nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations, climatic and catchment characteristics for up to 1406 larger rivers that were analysed between 1990 and 2016. We predict that 31{\%} of the global landmass contained catchments may exhibit undesirable levels of periphyton growth. Almost three-quarters (76{\%}) of undesirable periphyton growth was caused by P-enrichment and mapped to catchments dominated by agricultural land in North and South America and Europe containing 1.7B people. In contrast, undesirable periphyton growth due to N-enrichment was mapped to parts of North Africa and parts of the Middle East and India affecting 280{\thinspace}M people. The findings of this global modelling approach can be used by landowners and policy makers to better target investment and actions at finer spatial scales to remediate poor water quality owing to periphyton growth.},

We use new data sources, enhanced spatial resolution, and new analytical approaches to provide new estimates of the global abundance of surface-water bodies. A global model based on the Pareto distribution shows that the global extent of natural lakes is twice as large as previously known (304 million lakes; 4.2 million km2 in area) and is dominated in area by millions of water bodies smaller than 1 km2. Similar analyses of impoundments based on inventories of large, engineered dams show that impounded waters cover approximately 0.26 million km2. However, construction of low-tech farm impoundments is estimated to be between 0.1\% and 6\% of farm area worldwide, dependent upon precipitation, and represents ≫77,000 km2 globally, at present. Overall, about 4.6 million km2 of the earth's continental “land” surface (≫3\%) is covered by water. These analyses underscore the importance of explicitly considering lakes, ponds, and impoundments, especially small ones, in global analyses of rates and processes.},

Here, this study broadens the scope of previous attempts and simultaneously examines climate change vulnerability across sectors including ecosystem services, food, health, human habitat, infrastructure, and water. We use the Romano--Wolf technique to test multiple hypotheses and present the spatial--temporal severity of climate vulnerability and readiness to combat climate change and its impacts. Besides, we assess the long-term impact of climate change readiness and income expansion on sectoral-climate vulnerabilities. We find that high-income economies with high social, governance, and economic readiness have low climate vulnerability whereas developing economies with low income have high climate change exposure and sensitivity. Our empirical evidence could be used to prioritize limited resources in addressing and managing adaptive actions of extreme climate change vulnerabilities.},

The spatio-temporal patterns of such emissions under future climate changes at the national scale are not clearly addressed. In this study, we evaluate these emissions from 79 hydroelectric reservoirs across China (61.22 % of the national hydropower generation) in 2020, covering carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), using the G-res (Greenhouse Gas Reservoir) tool and Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment–Dynamic Global Nutrient Model (IMAGE-DGNM). A random forest (RF) model is also used to project the emissions in the period of 2020 to 2060 under Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios. The results indicate that the carbon intensity (CI) and areal flux varied largely. The reservoirs located in low-altitude areas and older reservoirs generally have higher CIs. N2O contributed with more than 80 % of the total GHG emission, in which the NH4+ concentration is a key factor influencing the N2O emissions. The projection shows that these emissions will increase by 1.30 %, 6.63 %, and 17.33 % in 2060 compared to 2020 under the SSP119, SSP245, and SSP585 scenarios, respectively, in which CH4 has the largest growth. Finally, implications toward reduction in such emissions are discussed.}

               important source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere, but current
               estimates are uncertain. The CH4 emitted from reservoirs is
               microbially produced in their sediments, but at present, the
               rate of CH4 formation in reservoir sediments cannot be predicted
               from sediment characteristics, limiting our understanding of

               incubation experiment that the CH4 formation rate in sediments
               of widely different tropical reservoirs can be predicted from
               sediment age and total nitrogen concentration. CH4 formation
               occurs predominantly in sediment layers younger than 6-12 years
               and beyond these layers sediment organic carbon may be
               considered effectively buried. Hence mitigating reservoir CH4
               emission via improving nutrient management and thus reducing
               organic matter supply to sediments is within reach. Our model of
               sediment CH4 formation represents a first step towards

pages={402-408},
abstract={Reservoir drawdown areas---where sediment is exposed to the atmosphere due to water-level fluctuations---are hotspots for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, the global extent of drawdown areas is unknown, precluding an accurate assessment of the carbon budget of reservoirs. Here we show, on the basis of satellite observations of 6,794 reservoirs between 1985 and 2015, that 15{\%} of the global reservoir area was dry. Exposure of drawdown areas was most pronounced in reservoirs close to the tropics and shows a complex dependence on climatic (precipitation, temperature) and anthropogenic (water use) drivers. We re-assessed the global carbon emissions from reservoirs by apportioning CO2 and methane emissions to water surfaces and drawdown areas using published areal emission rates. The new estimate assigns 26.2 (15--40) (95{\%} confidence interval) TgCO2-C yr−1 to drawdown areas, and increases current global CO2 emissions from reservoirs by 53{\%} (60.3 (43.2--79.5) TgCO2-C yr−1). Taking into account drawdown areas, the ratio between carbon emissions and carbon burial in sediments is 2.02 (1.04--4.26). This suggests that reservoirs emit more carbon than they bury, challenging the current understanding that reservoirs are net carbon sinks. Thus, consideration of drawdown areas overturns our conception of the role of reservoirs in the carbon cycle.},

abstract = {Carbon emissions from aquatic ecosystems, including reservoirs, play an important role in the global carbon budget, while the carbon cycle in reservoirs is still far from clearly understood. In this study, a vertical two-dimensional quality-hydrodynamic model (CE-QUAL-W2) was established to simulate CO2 fluxes and carbon transport in the Wujiangdu Reservoir in Southwest China, verified by field measurement in 2017. Thanks to overall good accuracy of multi-indicator simulation of the model (mean RRE = 23.4 %, mean NES = 0.67), CE-QUAL-W2 is considered as a valid module to simulate carbon flux in the reservoir. Based on the model, the average CO2 flux across the air–water interface of the reservoir was 4.37 mmol m−2 d-1. Temporally, CO2 fluxes in the cold season were higher than those in the warm season, indicating the important effect of seasonal temperature change on CO2 flux, as well as the effect of other parameters, such as DO, Chla, TN, TP and pH. Spatially, CO2 emission fluxes were lower in the water inlet area of the reservoir (2.74 mmol m−2 d-1) and in front of the dam (3.40 mmol m−2 d-1), but higher in the middle part of the reservoir (highest 5.42 mmol m−2 d-1 at Segment 54). Different discharge elevation scenarios were set up to model the influences of hydrodynamics on CO2 emission fluxes. When the water discharge elevation increased by 30 m, CO2 emission increased by 39.31 % and discharged downstream carbon decreased by 1.90 % compared with the actual working condition. Finally, the total mass of carbon released by the reservoir (the combination of carbon diffused into the atmosphere and carbon in released water) decreased by 1.85 % compared with the actual working condition. When the water discharge elevation decreased by 30 m, no obvious change of CO2 emission happened, but the total mass of carbon released by the reservoir increased by 1.44 %. This research confirmed the validity of CE-QUAL-W2 in simulating carbon flux in reservoirs. Our modelling results shed light on the influence of hydrodynamics on carbon emission in reservoirs, and optimizing water discharge elevation can be helpful to mitigate carbon emission from reservoirs.}

We source maps of agricultural ponds, compile a meta-analysis for their emissions and use published data to correct for temperature and the relative contributions of two methane fluxes (diffusion and ebullition). In the United States, 2.56 million agricultural ponds cover 420.9 kha and emit about 95.8{\thinspace}kt year−1 of methane. In Australia, 1.76 million agricultural ponds cover 291.2 kha and emit about 75.1{\thinspace}kt year−1 of methane. Despite large uncertainties, our findings suggest that small water bodies emit twice as much methane than is currently accounted for in national inventories.

abstract = {Abstract Because of their abundance and high emissions rates, small reservoirs (< 0.01 km2) can be important emitters of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane. However, emissions estimates from small reservoirs have lagged those of larger ones, and efforts to characterize small reservoir emissions have largely overlooked variations in emissions pathways, times, and locations. We intensively sampled four small reservoirs in Georgia, USA, during the summer to quantify the contribution and spatiotemporal variability of different emissions pathways (CO2 and CH4 diffusion, CH4 ebullition). We used these data to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of different sampling schemes. Every emissions pathway was dominant in one reservoir on one sampling day, and excluding ebullition caused misestimation between −89\% and −15\% of the total flux. Sampling only once daily caused misestimation between −78\% and 45\%, but sampling twice or just after dawn (07:00 h) reduced error. Sampling four or fewer locations caused misestimation between −85\% and 366\%, and our results indicated that 6–20 sampling locations may be needed for reasonable accuracy. The floating aquatic macrophyte Wolffia sp. (duckweed) appeared to exert control over emissions variability, and the consequences of not accounting for variability were greater in a duckweed-covered reservoir. Our results indicate that sampling only at 10:00 h (modal sampling time of prior efforts) may lead to the erroneous conclusion that reservoirs with high photosynthetic biomass are CO2 sinks rather than sources. Improving estimation accuracy by accounting for within-reservoir variation in emissions will facilitate more strategic management of these abundant, anthropogenic ecosystems.},

However, the availability of carbon substrates, which ultimately determines microbial carbon metabolism, has not been adequately accounted for. By combining a global database and a continental-scale experimental study, we showed that differences in the temperature dependence of global wetland methane and carbon dioxide emissions (EM/C) were dependent on soil carbon-to-nitrogen stoichiometry. This can be explained mainly by the positive relationship between soil organic matter decomposability and EM/C. Our study indicates that only 23{\%} of global wetlands will decrease methane relative to carbon dioxide emissions under future warming scenarios when soil organic matter decomposability is considered. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating soil organic matter biodegradability into model predictions of wetland carbon--climate feedback.},

abstract = {Abstract Freshwater ecosystem contributions to the global methane budget remains the most uncertain among natural sources. With warming and accompanying carbon release from thawed permafrost and thermokarst lake expansion, the increase of methane emissions could be large. However, the impact and relative importance of various factors related to warming remain uncertain. Based on diverse lake characteristics incorporated in modeling and observational data, we calibrate and verify a lake biogeochemistry model. The model is then applied to estimate global lake methane emissions and examine the impacts of temperature increase for the first and the last decades of the 21st century under different climate scenarios. We find that current emissions are 24.0 ± 8.4 Tg CH4 yr−1 from lakes larger than 0.1 km2, accounting for 11\% of the global total natural source as estimated based on atmospheric inversion. Future projections under the RCP8.5 scenario suggest a 58\%–86\% growth in emissions from lakes. Our model sensitivity analysis indicates that additional carbon substrates from thawing permafrost may enhance methane production under warming in the Arctic. Warming enhanced methane oxidation in lake water can be an effective sink to reduce the net release from global lakes.},

abstract={Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas and its concentrations have tripled in the atmosphere since the industrial revolution. There is evidence that global warming has increased CH4 emissions from freshwater ecosystems1,2, providing positive feedback to the global climate. Yet for rivers and streams, the controls and the magnitude of CH4 emissions remain highly uncertain3,4. Here we report a spatially explicit global estimate of CH4 emissions from running waters, accounting for 27.9 (16.7--39.7) Tg{\thinspace}CH4{\thinspace}per year and roughly equal in magnitude to those of other freshwater systems5,6. Riverine CH4 emissions are not strongly temperature dependent, with low average activation energy (EM{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.14{\thinspace}eV) compared with that of lakes and wetlands (EM{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.96{\thinspace}eV)1. By contrast, global patterns of emissions are characterized by large fluxes in high- and low-latitude settings as well as in human-dominated environments. These patterns are explained by edaphic and climate features that are linked to anoxia in and near fluvial habitats, including a high supply of organic matter and water saturation in hydrologically connected soils. Our results highlight the importance of land--water connections in regulating CH4 supply to running waters, which is vulnerable not only to direct human modifications but also to several climate change responses on land.},

abstract = {Abstract Lakes are important sentinels of climate change and may contribute over 30\% of natural methane (CH4) emissions; however, no earth system model (ESM) has represented lake CH4 dynamics. To fill this gap, we refined a process-based lake biogeochemical model to simulate global lake CH4 emissions, including representation of lake bathymetry, oxic methane production (OMP), the effect of water level on ebullition, new non-linear CH4 oxidation kinetics, and the coupling of sediment carbon pools with in-lake primary production and terrigenous carbon loadings. We compiled a lake CH4 data set for model validation. The model shows promising performance in capturing the seasonal and inter-annual variabilities of CH4 emissions at 10 representative lakes for different lake types and the variations in mean annual CH4 emissions among 106 lakes across the globe. The model reproduces the variations of the observed surface CH4 diffusion and ebullition along the gradients of lake latitude, depth, and surface area. The results suggest that OMP could play an important role in surface CH4 diffusion, and its relative importance is higher in less productive and/or deeper lakes. The model performance is improved for capturing CH4 outgassing events in non-floodplain lakes and the seasonal variability of CH4 ebullition in floodplain lakes by representing the effect of water level on ebullition. The model can be integrated into ESMs to constrain global lake CH4 emissions and climate-CH4 feedback.},

abstract = {Abstract Hydroelectric reservoirs can emit significant quantities of methane, particularly through degassing at turbine outlets. Improved understanding of processes affecting hydroelectric reservoir CH4 emissions is thus important as the world economy transitions to renewable forms of energy production. Here we develop and evaluate a new mechanistic model of CH4 emissions: ResME ([Res]ervoir [M]ethane [E]missions), which estimates carbon inputs and methanogenesis to predict CH4 release via ebullition and diffusion, plant emissions, and downstream emissions. ResME results demonstrate that the relative importance of allochthonous and autochthonous carbon input to methane emissions varies by latitude, with allochthonous carbon contributions typically being higher in tropical reservoirs. Results also demonstrate that total reservoir emissions are highly dependent on turbine intake depths, which are not typically reported. Potential maximum degassing emissions from existing hydroelectric reservoirs are estimated as 11 ± 4 Tg C/yr, if all reservoirs had deep turbine intakes and stratified for 5 months per year. In comparison, the estimated diffusive, ebullitive, and plant CH4 emissions are estimated to be 2.8 ± 0.2 Tg C/yr (where the true uncertainty is much higher than the model standard error). Future work should focus on improving estimates of reservoir carbon inputs and decomposition rates, as well as surveying turbine intake depths. Satellite measurements from missions such as TROPOMI may also help constrain hydropower methane emissions.},

ABSTRACT = {In view of the great paucity of information on the exact contributions of different causes which lead to different extents of emission of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4) form reservoirs, it is tremendously challenging to develop statistical or analytical models for forecasting such emissions. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have the ability to discern linear or non-linear relationships despite very limited data inputs and can recognize even complex patterns in a data set without a priori understating of the underlying mechanism. Hence, we have used ANNs to develop a model linking CH4 emissions to five of the reservoir parameters about which data is most commonly available in the prior art. Using a compendium of all available data on these parameters, of which a small part was kept aside for use in model validation, it has been possible to develop a model which is able to forecast CH4 emissions with a root mean square error of 37. It indicates a precision significantly better than the ones achieved in previous reports. The model provides a means to estimate CH4 emissions from reservoirs of which age, mean depth, surface area, latitude and longitude are known.},

ABSTRACT = {The mechanistic model LAKE2.3 was tested for its capability to predict of methane (CH4) emissions from reservoirs. Estimates of CH4 emissions from the Mozhaysk reservoir (Moscow region) provided by the model showed good agreement with instrumental in situ observations for several parameters of the water ecosystem. The average CH4 flux calculated by the model is 37.7 mgC-CH4 m−2 day−1, while according to observations, it is 34.4 mgC-CH4 m−2 day−1. Ebullition makes the largest contribution to the emissions from reservoirs (up to 95\%) due to low methane solubility in water and the high oxidation rate of diffusive methane flux. During the heating period, an increase in methane emission is observed both in the model and empirical data, with a maximum before the onset of the autumn overturn. An effective parameter for calibrating the diffusive methane flux in the model is the potential rate of methane oxidation. For ebullition flux, it is the parameter q10 (an empirical parameter determining the relationship between methane generation and temperature) because methane production in bottom sediments is the most important. The results of this research can be used to develop mechanistic models and provide a necessary step toward regional and global simulations of lacustrine methane emission using LAKE2.3.},

abstract = {Reservoirs play a crucial role as sources of methane (CH₄) emissions, with emission rates and quantities varying widely depending on reservoir size due to factors such as surface area, water depth, usage, operational methods, and spatial distribution. Gaining insights into emission characteristics across different reservoir sizes can aid in designing and managing reservoirs to mitigate CH₄ emissions effectively. In this study, machine learning models were applied to estimate both diffusive and ebullitive CH₄ emissions across 97,435 reservoirs in China, spanning five categories of storage capacity. This comprehensive assessment covers nearly all reservoirs within the country, revealing total CH₄ emissions of approximately 5,414 Gg. Reservoirs > 0.01 km3 are responsible for about 90 \% of these emissions, primarily due to high diffusive flux rates and extensive surface areas. Elevated CH₄ diffusion in reservoirs > 0.01 km3 is largely influenced by their thermal stratification and capacity for organic matter accumulation. Furthermore, these reservoirs are particularly vulnerable to climate warming, which could accelerate CH₄ emission rates more rapidly in larger reservoirs than in smaller ones (below 0.01 km³). Consequently, prioritising CH₄ management in reservoirs > 0.01 km3 is imperative. Nevertheless, the high ebullitive flux of CH₄ in reservoirs < 0.01 km3, linked to their shallow depth, highlighting the potential for significant CH4 ebullition from smaller aquatic systems. Given large and small-ranged reservoirs' distinct spatial distribution patterns, targeted management strategies are recommended: project-level management for large reservoirs and basin-level approaches for smaller reservoirs.}

Yet seasonal and temporal patterns of CO2 flux from periodically exposed sediments in drawdown areas remain poorly understood. Here we evaluate the annual and diel (24-hour cycle) variations in CO2 emissions from sediments periodically exposed to the atmosphere. We sampled sediments in the drawdown area of a tropical reservoir, which encompassed two primary adjacent land covers—grassland and forestland—in the watershed of a reservoir located in southeastern Brazil. We also experimentally assessed the effect of rewetting on CO2 emissions from exposed sediments. We found large variations in emissions during all hydrological periods (from 10 to 10116 mg C/m−2(−|-) d-1), except for the late rainy period. Land use and how distant dry sediments were from the open water significantly affected drawdown CO2 emissions, with higher emissions occurring in areas surrounded by forest than those adjacent to grassland. Our diel-cycle analysis did not show significant variation of emissions over daily cycles. Furthermore, a rewetting experiment indicated a significant increase in emissions 30 min after the onset of the rewetting event. Although drawdown areas only cover 20\% of the reservoir’s area, they account for 80\% of the reservoir’s total CO2 emissions. Ultimately, single-time measurements can lead to considerable underestimation (up to 52\%) or overestimation (up to 190\%) of whole-reservoir CO2 emissions.}

               performed, and prevention strategies with practical application
               assessments were developed. Water level operation control in the
               reservoir from April to September can be divided into five
               stages (falling-rising-oscillating-falling-rising), with algal
               blooms occurring only in the second stage. The rising water
               level with inflow into the middle layers shapes a closed-loop
               circulation in the surface waters. This distributes the
               nutrients that were trapped in the surface layer during the
               first stage, helping algae avoid to phosphorus limitation and
               thrive in the closed loop circulation, leading to algal blooms
               (chlorophyll-a exceeding 10 mg/m3). There is a significant
               positive correlation (p < 0.05) between algal blooms and the
               rapid rise in water levels in the second stage, occurring within
               a span of three days. To contain the algal bloom, a water level
               operation limit of rising waters on the third day after a
               two-day consecutive rise in water level was examined. This was
               found to be effective after its practical application to the
               case reservoir in 2022, with chlorophyll-a concentrations
               consistently below 10 mg/m3. This study unveils the mechanisms

ABSTRACT = {Because methane is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG), understanding controls on methane emissions from reservoirs is an important goal. Yet, reservoirs are complex ecosystems, and mechanisms by which reservoir operations influence methane emissions are poorly understood. In part, this is because emissions occur in ‘hot spots’ and ‘hot moments’. In this study, we address three research questions, ‘What are the causal pathways through which reservoir operations and resulting water level fluctuations (WLF) influence methane emissions?’; ‘How do influences from WLF differ for seasonal drawdown and diurnal hydropeaking operations?’; and ‘How does understanding causal pathways inform practical options for mitigation?’. A graphical conceptual model is presented that links WLF in reservoirs to methane emissions via four causal pathways: (1) water-column mixing (2) drying–rewetting cycles, (3) sediment delivery and redistribution, and (4) littoral vegetation. We review what is known about linkages for WLF at seasonal and diurnal resolutions generate research questions, and hypothesize strategies for moderating methane emissions by interrupting each causal pathway. Those related to flow management involve basin-scale management of tributary flows, seasonal timing of hydropeaking (pathway #1), timing and rates of drawdown (pathway #2). In addition, we describe how sediment (pathway #3) and vegetation management (pathway #4) could interrupt linkages between WLF and emissions. We demonstrate the strength of conceptual modeling as a tool for generating plausible hypotheses and suggesting mitigation strategies. Future research is needed to develop simpler models at appropriate timescales that can be validated and used to manage flow releases from reservoirs.},

ABSTRACT = {Freshwater reservoirs are considered as the source of atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG), but more than 96\% of global reservoirs have never been monitored. Compared to the difficulty and high cost of field measurements, statistical models are a better choice to simulate the carbon emissions from reservoirs. In this study, two types of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) and Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN), were used to predict carbon dioxide (CO2) flux emissions from reservoirs based on the published data. Input variables, which were latitude, age, the potential net primary productivity, and mean depth, were selected by Spearman correlation analysis, and then the rationality of these inputs was proved by sensitivity analysis. Besides this, a Multiple Non-Linear Regression (MNLR) and a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) were used for comparison with ANNs. The performance of models was assessed by statistical metrics both in training and testing phases. The results indicated that ANNs gave more accurate results than regression models and GRNN provided the best performance. With the help of this GRNN, the total CO2 emitted by global reservoirs was estimated and possible CO2 flux emissions from a planned reservoir was assessed, which illustrated the potential application of GRNN.},
